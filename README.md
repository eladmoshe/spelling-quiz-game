Welcome to Spelling Quiz - an interactive and engaging way to improve your spelling skills! This game makes practicing English spelling fun and effective.

## Deployment and GitHub Pages üöÄ

Spelling Quiz includes an automated build and deployment system optimized for GitHub Pages:

- **Automatic Fixes**: The build process automatically fixes common GitHub Pages issues
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site automatically
- **Build Validation**: Catches issues that would break the app in production

To ensure your changes will work in production:

```bash
# Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/make-executable.sh
./scripts/make-executable.sh

# Standard build with GitHub Pages fixes automatically applied
npm run build          # Builds the app with post-build fixes

# Validate the build
npm run validate       # Validates the build output
```

The **post-build script** automatically:
- Creates the required `.nojekyll` file
- Fixes asset paths for GitHub Pages
- Adds proper base tag
- Ensures script tags have correct type attributes

See [GitHub Pages Deployment Guide](GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed information.

> **Note:** Performance tests are not supported and have been disabled in this project. The test suite focuses on functional correctness rather than performance benchmarks.
