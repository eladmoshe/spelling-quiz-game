# E2E Test Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test ID Inconsistencies

The primary issue causing the e2e test failures was a mismatch between the test IDs used in the tests and the actual test IDs implemented in the components.

Specifically:
- Tests were looking for elements with `data-testid="next-word-button"`
- But the component was actually using `data-testid="next-button"`

### Fixed Files

1. **error-handling.spec.ts**
   - Changed two instances of `next-word-button` to `next-button`
   - Line ~119: For the "should recover from reload during game" test
   - Line ~159: For the "should handle network speech synthesis error" test

2. **localization.spec.ts**
   - Changed two instances of `next-word-button` to `next-button`
   - Line ~126: For the "should handle right-to-left text input correctly" test
   - Line ~93: For the "should persist language across game screens" test

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue was likely introduced during the refactoring process when either:
1. The component test IDs were updated without updating the corresponding e2e tests
2. The e2e tests were written against an earlier version of the component with different test IDs

### Prevention Strategy

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Consider creating a constants file to define all test IDs in one place
2. Add more detailed comments in e2e tests explaining which elements they're interacting with
3. Run e2e tests as part of the refactoring process to catch these issues earlier

## Verification

After these changes, all 23 e2e tests should pass successfully, confirming that the UI interactions work correctly after the refactoring.
